	<h2>About This Site</h2>
This site was created by me to learn a little Markdown, Jekyll and Github Pages.  I have had a lot of IT experiences over the years and blogging seems to be a good avenue to share back with the community that has given me a career.

	<h2>About Me</h2>
I care about IT Operations and IT Security.  Today I'm a Seattle based Systems Engineer and enjoy creating services that enable business security, user productivity, and business growth.  In the past, I've designed networks and Microsoft central solutions for small businesses, startups, and mid-large companies.  <br> 
Away from the keyboard, my extracurricular activities include beer-league soccer, taekwondo black belt student and coach, HOA secretary, GTAA non-profit board member, and father to a beautiful family.
