**How come I need to do AD Schema updates for every Exchange CU?!**

{{ more }}

No need to rehash what this guy has done.  I had to update the forest and domains for Exchange CU upgrades.  This page has info on how to find what AD Schema version you are on using ADSIEdit or Powershell.  And contains all the Exchange version number definitions.  I'm saving this one for future reference.

<p>Very good page for AD Forest and Domain schema version upgrades.</p>
