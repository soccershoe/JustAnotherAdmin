title: "Just Another Admin, Launches Site"

I'm putting this on the interwebs.  Putting together a central knowledge location for myself.  Sharing with the world and seeing if I can learn anything in the process.  
This site wouldn't be possible without the fantastic tutorial from Jonathan McGlone, @jmcglone.

**Update**
I'm not a professional developer.  I make powershell scripts, which would be the closest I come to development.  And sometimes I use a Mac.  I'm trying to use Github and VSCode in an attempt to dip my foot into the dev community and figure out how they work in an effort to better suppot them.  And now I'm trying to use Ruby for managing this site even though I have no idea what I'm doing.  :worried:

I needed to update Ruby.  How do you update Ruby?  I have no idea.  But I found a great guide by @ianrahman.
