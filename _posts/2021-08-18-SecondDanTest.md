**The History of Taekwondo**

Taekwondo is not only a martial art, but a code of conduct.  Many schools teach, or have students say the “Tenants of Taekwondo” before or after class to help ingrain in them the importance of being a better human being.  The tenants are not just made up to teach kids but are steeped in a culture history of Taekwondo and the Korean people.  It is this historical lineage that imparts upon the students of Taekwondo a sense of something larger and more important that the memorization of movements.  Just as symbolized in the Taegeuk symbol, the mind needs to be balanced with the body.  
The Tenants of Taekwondo:
•	Courtesy
•	Integrity
•	Perseverance
•	Self-Control
•	Indominable Spirit

For thousands of years, Korea was an intersection of Culture.  The intersection of China, Japan and Mongolia, which created on the Korean peninsula a unique people.  With the mixture of culture comes trade and sharing, but also strife and war.  Because the intersection of these powerful civilizations, the Korean people needed to defend themselves or regain their independence.  Usually outnumbered or not as rich, the Korean people needed to be faster and stronger.  They needed a better way to train their military, to survive, and thus, beginnings of Taekwondo emerged.

During this time, there was an influence of Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism, again highlighting the cultural influences on the peninsula.  The importance of leading a principled life was seemingly as important as survival.  These religious teachings spread from all over, influencing life on the Korean peninsula.  

A precursor of Taekwondo took root as a systematized practice during the three-kingdom period of Korea.  The three kingdoms were the Silla, Koguryo, and Paekje.  They were founded between 57-18BC.  The three kingdoms fought with each other for several hundred years, trying to unite the country.  The suggested purpose was not necessarily to conquer, but to create a national unity and pride, as well as to protect the people from foreign invaders.  

The smallest of the three kingdoms, Silla, created a group of youth called the Hwarang, or “The way of the Flowering Manhood”.  The Hwarang were young men conscripted into service to the state, usually of aristocratic birth.  They became leaders in politics, art, science, and combat.  During the three-kingdom period, the Silla began solidifying and intensifying the art of combat into the beginnings of Taekwondo, called Taekkyon (918AD).  The solidification of various differing martial arts styles and influences was of great benefit.  The cultural intersection that was this peninsula brought these many influences together.  Broader public followers of the Hwarang were called the Hwarangdo, or “followers of Hwarang”.  They took up the training and teachings of the Hwarang in hopes to serve country and better themselves.  The Hwarangdo would become the first official military system.

The code of conduct, or five commandments, of the Hwarang was solidified in the Buddhist teachings of Wong Gwang and created a basis for how to live their life as Hwarang.  
•	To serve the king with loyalty
•	To serve one’s parents with loyalty
•	To always show loyalty to one’s friends
•	To never retreat in battle
•	To never kill unnecessarily

Eventually, in 676AD, Silla and the Hwarang unified the three-kingdoms of the Korean peninsula.  During this time of the unification, Buddhism heavily influenced Silla.  It was eventually named the official religion of the state.  Buddhist monks often provided physical training to the Hwarang.  Imparting their religious instruction was just as an important part of their education.  

The path of the history of Taekwondo continues through several hundred years.  Invasions from the Mongols, the Chinese, Manchu, and Japanese provided ample opportunity for the Korean peninsula to defend itself and spread its culture and fighting prowess.  Stories and legends of heroes exist in Chinese and Japanese history showing feats of honor and strength exhibited by the Hwarang.  The code of ethics of the Hwarang, as shown in legend, exemplify a level of courage, wisdom and conduct that are shown little throughout history.  

Over the centuries, Korean martial arts have influenced other martial arts outside of the peninsula.  This includes warrior classes like the Samurai or Ninja.  And also includes fighting styles like like bushido and jiujitsu.  Not only was the physical skills and training, but the exchange of culture included the spread of ideals and religion.  

Eventually, starting around the 13th century, the importance of hand-to-hand combat in military use declined.  This is most likely due to the rise of gunpowder and the importance of other weapons gaining influence.  But as the influence of the Hwarang and the practice of martial arts declined, the practice continued through until 1910, when the Japanese annexed the Korean peninsula.

The Japanese annexation was from 1910 to 1945 after years of war, intimidation and political pressure.  During this time, the Japanese destroyed much of the culture of the Korean people.  Schools were forbidden to speak Korean.  Films were forced to be made in Japanese.  Over 200,000 historical documents were burned.  The culture of Korea was erased, and in some cases, the culture mixed.  The practice of Korean martial arts did not escape the Japanese invasion and was banned.  Many Korean men were conscripted into the Japanese army.  In some cases, the Korean martial arts were culturally appropriated and renamed to Japanese versions.  But not all culture was lost.  Some men continued to practice Korean martial arts in secrecy.  There were also protests of the annexation and underground groups fighting against Japanese invasion.  The spirit of Taekwondo and the Korean people continued under extreme pressure.

After World War II, and the exit of Japanese rule on the Korean peninsula, Korean martial arts schools opened once again.  Many schools had backgrounds in Japanese and Chinese fighting styles from the history of occupation.  The military decided to introduce a unified system of fighting.  Over the next several decades, several differently labeled factions of styles formed, and created their own organizations, and the name Taekwondo was formed.  The World Taekwondo organization is the largest and most influential today, gaining status and reputation all over the world.  Taekwondo is once again spreading its culture and influence across borders.

The history of Taekwondo and the history of the Korean people are embodied in the five Tenants of Taekwondo: Courtesy, Integrity, Perseverance, Self-Control, and Indominable Spirit.  While these may be a more modern understanding, the historical thread of their meaning reaches centuries.  The purpose, to build a moral character, positive personality, and human respect.  Of being a better human, building friends, growing our circles of influence, all represent that mixing of culture, however small or large continues as the History of Taekwondo.
