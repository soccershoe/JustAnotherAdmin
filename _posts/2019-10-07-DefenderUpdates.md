<h1>Windows Defender Definition Manual Updates</h1>
<p>Since I'm doing this infrequently, but enough to keep forgetting the link, I'll post this for myself to remember.</p>

<p>Download and run the file to update Defender.  This is helpful when you don't have access to the internet.  In my case, we use PAW's that don't have access to the internet other than connecting to VPN.  If the PAW hasn't been turned on in a while, the VPN won't connect if Defender isn't updated.  VPN security restrictions at my job.</p>
